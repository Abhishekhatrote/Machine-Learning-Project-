#Credit Card Approval Prediction
Overview
This project focuses on predicting credit card approval using data-driven methods and machine learning models. The goal is to assist banks in efficiently processing credit card applications, minimizing the risk of default, and improving overall decision-making.

Key Features
Data Processing: Comprehensive preprocessing steps, including handling missing values, feature engineering, and data visualization.
Machine Learning Models: Implemented Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, XG Boost, and Random Forest for credit card approval prediction.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): In-depth exploration of dataset characteristics, visualizing correlations, and gaining insights into key factors influencing credit approval.
SQL Advanced Analysis: Conducted advanced SQL queries to extract meaningful information from the dataset.
Model Accuracy
Logistic Regression: 88%
Decision Tree: 84%
XG Boost: 91%
Random Forest: 92%
Impact on Banking Sector
